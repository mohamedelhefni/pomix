Pomix is a progressive web app (PWA) that helps you boost your productivity and focus.
Pomix is a combination of pomodoro and mix. Pomodoro is a time management technique that helps you focus and avoid distractions. Mix means that you can mix different categories and tasks in your sessions and get a variety of statistics. Pomix also sounds like remix, which implies that you can customize the app to your liking.
